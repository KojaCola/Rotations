## VectorMC Atlas Rotations

This repository stores map rotations for the servers on VectorMC's Atlas servers. Each file listed under the "servers" directory corresponds to a server on VectorMC and contains the sequence of maps for that server.

### Suggesting Rotation Changes

Community members may propose rotation changes using either **Issues** or **Pull Requests**, although for organizational purposes, Issues are preferred. 

When proposing changes, please keep in mind that all changes should be detailed in the Issue or Pull Request's description, and make sure that they are consistent with the servers' allowed gamemodes.

New servers/gamemodes are **not** to be suggested here for proposed gamemode rotations. Instead, use the [forums](http://vectormc.net/forums) for your ideas.

### How it works
All changes that are committed to this repository are reflected on their respective servers, and are pulled after every restart.

**Changes go live immediately.
